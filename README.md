Objective: Predicted student dropouts using machine learning to enable timely interventions.
Dataset: Analyzed data from 4,424 students (2008â€“2019) with academic, demographic, and financial attributes.
Algorithms: Implemented Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and AdaBoost.
Techniques: Used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and 5-fold cross-validation for optimization.
Results: Achieved ~78% accuracy; Random Forest and AdaBoost performed best.
Key Insights: Identified tuition status, academic performance, and demographics as top risk factors.
Tools: Python, Google Colab, Pandas, Scikit-learn.
Impact: Offered a scalable solution to reduce dropout rates and improve student retention.
